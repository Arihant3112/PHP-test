            <font face="Segoe UI Light">

            	The Moto Z is an Android phone with a new name that begins at the end of the alphabet, but is actually pioneering modular connectivity in a more robust way than its competitors.
<br><br>
It's the world's thinnest phone at 5.19mm in so-called "thickness," and it feels incredibly thin to hold. This isn't another meaningless marketing stat. Yet you shouldn't want it to stay this slim.
<br><br>
There are already four practical, modular accessories - more than we have seen with the add-on-deprived LG G5 - and they satisfyingly and securely attach to the back of this phone with magnets.
<br><br>
Moto Z's "build out your smartphone" concept is fun and, importantly, its MotoMods are creative and well-designed. There's everything from a predictable (but essential) battery back, to a more wild pico projector.
<br><br>
Three things will throw people about the Moto Z: its lack of a headphone jack in favor of audio through the USB Type-C port, its initially limited availability and its un-Moto-like price.
<br><br>
Its USB-C means of piping audio to earbuds means that the phone comes with an easily losable 3.5mm adapter, and you won't be able to charge and play music through headphones at the same time.
<br><br>
Moto Z is a smartphone that takes thinness to a new level with a flagship-worthy stainless steel frame that measures 153.3 x 75.3 x 5.19mm. It weighs just 139g and feels astonishingly wafer-thin in one hand.
<br><br>
It's the world's thinnest phone at 5.19mm in so-called thickness.
<br><br>
What's uncanny about its dimensions is that Motorola introduced its thickness as 5.2 inches at Lenovo Tech World unveiling in June. When has a company ever rounded up on their smartphone thickness?
<br><br>
This may be why Motorola didn't call it the Moto X 2016, even though that's really what this is. The design drops the curved back and familiar Motorola dimple for a flat and boxy shape that still feels good to hold.
<br><br>
All of this means that it's so thin it doesn't even include a normal 3.5mm headphone jack. Yes, Motorola beat Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to dropping the headphone jack in favor of charging-audio output "solution."
<br><br>
Fingerprints are more of a problem everywhere else on the Moto Z. This phone is a fingerprint and grease magnet - maybe to a world-record level, too. Both the front glass and the stainless steel back have been perpetually covered in smudges since day one. It's not very appealing or easy to wipe clean.

            <br><br><br>
            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
  				Moto Z takes the modular accessory idea we liked so much about the LG G5 and actually makes it work with better add-ons and an easier-to-use snap-on design.
<br><br>
It's an Android phone that performs well right now and the potential behind its future accessories hold a lot of promise down the road. Usually when we talk about mid-cycle upgrades, we're strictly talking about new software. Moto Z could take on new form at any time.
<br><br>
MotoMods really make this smartphone desireable. Right now, there are textured shells, fashionable battery cases, a powerful-enough JBL speaker and a bright-enough mini projector, and they're all great ideas that take advantage of the magnetic back pins.
<br><br>
The design is already incredibly thin, so the extra thickness isn't an impractical trade-off. The accessories, sensor-filled Moto Active display and fingerprint sensor that wakes and puts the phone to sleep are what make this phone stand out from the other half-dozen flagships with a Snapdragon 820 processor.

            <font size="+2" face="Calibri light" color="#3A7EF5"><br><br>Should you buy it?</font>
            <br><br><br>
            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
            	Moto Z isn't the first or last modular phone, but it's the first time we liked the idea on an Android device and see the potential behind building out our smartphone with new accessories. Options like a pico projector and attachable boom box are creative enough at launch that they could inspire a new way of thinking about how we use phones. Moto Z is more than just an unchanging sheet glass and metal.
<br><br>
The more boring LG G5 didn't live up to that promise and Google's Project Ara, while more ambitious, isn't ready for mainstream consumers just yet. The Moto Z falls somewhere in between, and delivers on everyone's standard smartphone needs too: a fast processor, enough memory and internal storage, and a solid performing camera except in low light. Its battery life and audio delivered via USB-C are major hurdles, but as long as you know about them going in, or find (or create) a future mod to correct the issues, there's no reason to automatically bypass Motorola as an also-ran in your best phone buying decision.
