            	The OnePlus 3 is the company's latest effort to redefine the definition of what a flagship smartphone really is.
<br><br>
While the previous two generations had their own set of successes and failures, one thing cannot be denied is that OnePlus ushered in the era of 'affordable flagships' (or flagship killers as some people like to call them) making way for the likes of the Xiaomi Mi5, the LeEco Le Max and many many more.
<br><br>
No matter what your opinion about the company or it's controversial invite system, one thing is for sure that you cannot be indifferent towards them. And it seems that with the OnePlus 3, the company may finally have delivered what it has been promising ever since the launch of the OnePlus One.
<br><br>
Featuring a gorgeous full metal unibody design, the smartphone finally doesn't just pack flagship level specifications, but also looks the part.
<br><br>
OnePlus has truly gone all out with the OnePlus 3, packing Snapdragons most powerful processor, the 820, 6GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage. Realising its mistakes, the company has packed NFC and QuickCharging (Dash Charge, in OnePlus speak), both of which were missing in the OnePlus 2, in the One Plus 3. Basically, we have everything and the kitchen sink packed in a gorgeous and svelte chassis.
<br><br>
This might be the most important section of the review, as this is where the OnePlus 3 has taken the biggest leap over it's predecessors.
<br><br>
When the OnePlus One was launched, it was unique, it dared to challenge the conventional price tiers of budget, mid-range and flagship as set by the mainstream companies like Samsung or LG. Thus for the same reason, the fact that it was made out of polycarbonate was forgiven.
<br><br>
Now with the OnePlus 3, OnePlus finally seems to have nailed it. The smartphone really looks incredibly premium with it's metal uni-body construction. Cut from a single slab of aluminum, the smartphone looks sleek and svelte, especially in the Graphite colour, which is what I have got for review.
<br><br>
The only 'sore' point of the design has to be the camera that sticks out of the back. Now compared to the iPhone 6s or the Moto Z, the bulge is not so prominent and doesn't look that out of place, but still breaks the flow of the design.
<br><br>
Now, the front is an all-glass affair protected by Gorilla Glass 4, with the front camera, a notification LED (wish more manufacturers included this feature), the proximity and ambient light sensors and the earpiece on the top and the capacitive key for back and recent apps along with the physical home button underneath the display.

  				The OnePlus 3 looks fantastic, with a sleek and svelte design. The build quality is exceptional, and the device now finally has the looks to match it's 'flagship killer' moniker.
<br><br>
The display, while not QHD, is bright, vivid and punchy, with great sunlight legibility. On the imaging front as well the smartphone doesn't fail to impress, and while the results aren't as impressive as the likes of the S7, they are fantastic nonetheless.
<br><br>
Additionally, OnePlus has remedied the mistakes it made with the OnePlus 2 and has included fast charging and NFC in the OnePlus 2. 'DashCharge' also works brilliantly and really lives up-to its claims.

            <font size="+2" face="Calibri light" color="#3A7EF5"><br><br>Should you buy it?</font>

            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
            	The company, which has been promising a flagship killer for three years now, might have come extremely close with the OnePlus 3. It is truly an excellent piece of kit, with a stunning, sleek and svelte design that looks incredibly premium, a bright and vivid display, near stock Android experience with Oxygen OS, top of the line specifications and a fantastic camera setup.
<br><br>
This is a device that can well and truly stand tall with the flagships of the world. Yes, you are stuck with 64GB of storage, the battery life is mediocre and it lacks a QHD display, but then it is quite a bit cheaper than the top-end flagships as well.
<br><br>
The memory management issues are a downer, and the 6GB of RAM for now remains more of a gimmick, but we have to give the benefit of doubt to OnePlus, who promise they will fix this issue in through an OTA. Moreover, the inherent memory issues in Android are not something OnePlus can do much about.
<br><br>
OnePlus might have finally done it. They finally have a device that can live upto the claims set by them two years ago, a device than blurs the line between mid-rangers and flagships. What seals the deal is the fact that OnePlus has finally ditched the inane Invite system, and the device can be bought 'normally'.
<br><br>
This leaves me excited for the OnePlus 4, if it eliminates the few issues the OnePlus 3 faces, it truly will be extraordinary.
