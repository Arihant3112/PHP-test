            	Nexus is dead. Pixel is king. Say hello to the Google Pixel, a handset ushering in a new era of the search giant's smartphone range.
<br><br>
It arrives alongside the larger (and even more expensive) Google Pixel XL, as the firm doubles up on devices for another year.
<br><br>
The Pixel takes over from 2015's Nexus 5X as the smaller offering in Google's lineup. The thing is though, it hasn't inherited its predecessor's price point, with the new Pixel sporting a decidedly more premium tag.
<br><br>
Previous Nexus devices had a leg-up over the competition with their slightly lower price tag, which helped users overlook a couple of shortcomings; but in 2016, with the new Pixel brand and a brave new price point, there's nowhere to hide.
<br><br>
If you've owned a Google-brand smartphone in the past you'll appreciate the no-nonsense stock Google interface - and you'll be glad to know it's business as usual on the Pixel when it comes to the Android Nougat operating system.
<br><br>
For those who are new to Google's handsets, things may be less clear. While HTC is the firm that has actually built the device, the search giant has made all the calls on what goes into the Pixel, and how it operates.
<br><br>
These handsets are aimed to showcase the best of Google and Android. They pack new features not seen before on the platform (Google Assistant and a 'best-in-class' camera in the Pixel's case), and you'll be first in line for an update when a new version of Android is launched - usually weeks, if not months ahead of the likes of Samsung, LG, Sony and co.
<br><br>
The Google Pixel sports a first for Google's smaller smartphone - a full glass and metal body - along with a 5-inch full HD display, Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, 12MP rear camera, fingerprint scanner and 8MP front snapper.
<br><br>
On paper at least, then, the Google Pixel looks to be a flagship contender - but can it live up to the hype - and that price tag - in real life?
<br><br>
The Google Pixel design is premium, if slightly odd. There's a metal body, but Google has added a block of glass around the fingerprint scanner and camera on the rear. While this gives the Pixel a unique look, the glass finish does look and feel a little like plastic.
<br><br>
With a heap of power under the hood and a decent display, the Google Pixel is nicely set up for all your music, movies and gaming requirements.
<br><br>
Play Music is the place for music playback (unless you head to the Play Store and download something like Spotify), and as well as accessing any tracks you've put on the Pixel from your personal collection, it also gives you access to Google's own pay-monthly streaming service.
<br><br>
If you fancy owning your music you can also nip to the Play Store, which has an extensive catalog of albums and singles available for purchase and download.

            <font size="+2" face="Calibri light" color="#3A7EF5"><br><br>Who's it for?</font>
            <br><br><br>
            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
            	The Google Pixel isn't like its Nexus-named predecessors. This isn't a phone looking to give you flagship specs for a cut-down price - it's a flagship phone, and it has a flagship price tag.
<br><br>
Google's own line of smartphones are no longer aimed at those looking for a deal. We saw evidence of the switch with the Nexus 6P, which carried a larger price tag, and the search giant's shift to battling with the big boys is now complete.
<br><br>
The Google Pixel is for the tech-savvy and cash-rich who want to feel the latest tech in their pocket without the overbearing presence of the 5.5-inch Pixel XL.
<br><br>
It offers something different to the HTC 10, Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 which are more feature-led, with the Pixel instead designed to deliver a top-notch user experience and all the right tools in all the right places - which it does.
<br><br>
            </p>

            <font size="+2" face="Calibri light" color="#3A7EF5"><br><br>Should you buy it?</font>
            <br><br><br>
            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
            	The Google Pixel is an excellent flagship phone. It combines a heap of power and a slick interface with a solid camera and premium design - a combo which will have almost universal appeal.
<br><br>
It doesn't quite hit the high marks of the Galaxy S7 though, with the Pixel's battery performance putting it below a number of flagship rivals, but as long as you've got a charging cable to hand you won't be disappointed.
<br><br>
You are paying top dollar for the Google Pixel, and at this price point the competition is fierce. It's not the best phone around - that honor stays with the Galaxy S7 Edge (and S7) for now - but the Pixel offers up something a little different for Android thanks to its simplicity.
<br><br>
The Pixel is a breath of fresh Android air in a world of over-complication, and you'll feel rejuvenated using it.
<br><br>
