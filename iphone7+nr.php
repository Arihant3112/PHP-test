            	'The iPhone 7 Plus: is it a phone worth the cost?' is probably the question on your lips - and the answer is yes. In fact it's excellent, but there are a few caveats.
<br><br>
People will be quick to point out that not a lot has changed over the iPhone 6S Plus, and they'd be right. Apart from the waterproof body, extra power under the hood, dual cameras and questionable removal of the headphone jack, the two handsets are rather similar, especially visually.
<br><br>
There's not really any big innovation to speak of - although the Cupertino firm may point to the new camera engine and force touch home key - so the 7 Plus is another incremental upgrade, a bag of refinements making it two in a row from Apple since it introduced its first phablet in the iPhone 6 Plus.
<br><br>
While it may have not re-written the mobile landscape with the 7 Plus, Apple has taken the weaker parts of the 6S Plus and enhanced them on its new phone. The camera now feels supercharged over its predecessor, producing even better shots on a regular basis with minimum effort.
<br><br>
Battery life is improved, although not by much, and the waterproof design provides you with extra peace of mind that your expensive new smartphone will be able to survive a slip into the bath - whether that matters to you depends on how careless you are with your handset.
<br><br>
The price is high, especially if you're considering shelling out for the 256GB model, but the entry level 32GB iPhone 7 Plus is cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - so it's not as if Apple is going above and beyond all competitors.
<br><br>
The other potential sticking point is the lack of a headphone jack. The internet has been rife with opinion for and against the move Apple calls "courageous" - and it will be a matter of personal opinion as to which side of the fence you fall on. Bundled Lightning connected EarPods and a 3.5mm port adaptor soften the blow, but for some this will annoy.

            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
           The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly the better of the two new iPhones. It has a bigger battery, dual cameras and more RAM under the hood, providing excellent performance and if your decision is based on specs alone you won't be disappointed with the iPhone 7 Plus.
<br><br>
The camera is a serious leap forward from previous iPhones, and with its easy-to-use interface it's perfect for those wanting a dependable yet simple snapper in their pocket which can perform well in pretty much any scenario.
<br><br>
Add to that the water resistance body and you've finally feel like you have an iPhone which can survive the little mishaps life throws at you, which is good news for the more active.
<br><br>
The large screen, enhanced performance and new dual speakers also make the iPhone 7 Plus great for those who like to game or Netflix on the go without the hindrance of headphones.
<br><br>
While this may be the better phone on paper, the iPhone 7 is the one which will likely appeal to a wider demographic with its more manageable form factor and lower price tag.
<br><br>

            <font size="+2" face="Calibri light" color="#3A7EF5"><br><br>Should you buy it?</font>
            <br><br><br>
            <font face="Segoe UI Light">
            <p>
           Apple has given the iPhone 7 Plus enough new features for it to be seen as the next generation iPhone, but it's a close run thing. If you currently have an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus you'll be much better off waiting for the iPhone 7S/iPhone 8 in 2017.
<br><br>
For those nearing the end of their two year iPhone 6/6 Plus (or Android flagship) contracts though the iPhone 7 Plus is a much more enticing proposition, and you'll appreciate the upgrades and performance boost much more.
<br><br>
There is a case to be made for saving yourself some money without losing loads of features and picking up the iPhone 6S Plus instead, but the upgrades on the iPhone 7 Plus - especially the dual camera - make it a much more impressive buy than the smaller iPhone 7, and when the upgrades come to the camera software a real worthwhile upgrade.
