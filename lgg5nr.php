            	The LG G5 is a massive change of pace for the South Korean firm. It's done away with the cheap plastic and confusing leather finishes of the LG G4 in favor of a full metal body, while keeping fan-favorite features like a removable battery and microSD card.
<br><br>
That's a big deal, because Samsung disappointed a vocal minority when it ditched its swappable battery and expandable storage hallmarks for the Galaxy S6, although it realized the errors of its way as it reinstated microSD support in the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge a year later.
<br><br>
The LG G5 may not be as ornate as Samsung's glass-and-metal-fused phone, or Apple's aluminum iPhone 6S, but it's a step in the right direction after the questionably styled G4.
<br><br>
You don't really need either of these accessories to enjoy the camera or audio, though. LG G5 has a dual-camera setup on the back, with one lens that provides extra-wide photos.
<br><br>
The front is highlighted by an always-on, 5.3-inch display. It never goes to sleep, with the time, date and notification icons visible when the phone is off.
<br><br>
When it comes to price, it launched at around $650 (£500, AU$890) SIM-free for the LG G5, which put it slightly below the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S. Thing is, the G5 hasn't exactly been flying off the shelves.
<br><br>
It's already seen its SIM-free price slashed to $450 (£420, around AU$600) in some places, and LG has openly admitted it's been disappointment with the G5's "somewhat slow" sales.
<br><br>
Add to that the fact the South Korean firm has now teased us with its next flagship device - the LG V20 - complete with Google's upcoming Android 7 Nougat software which will be arriving in the next couple of months and you'd think that perhaps the G5 has been shifted to the back, burner.
<br><br>
It's far from over for the LG G5 though, and there's still a lot to love about this smart modular phone.
<br><br>
The LG G5 looks and feels completely different to the G4, and that's thanks to the all-metal body that rightfully kicks the plastic to the curb.
<br><br>
It feels suitably smooth, although the G5 struggles to feel as premium the likes of the iPhone 6S or Samsung Galaxy S7. That's thanks to a relatively thick layer of primer-paint mix which LG has used to the color the G5.
<br><br>
Initially I thought the G5 felt more like plastic, and it can be deceiving, but the sturdy aluminum frame becomes more apparent the more you use it. This doesn't mean the G5 feels cheap, far from it in fact, but the finish doesn't sing in your hand.

  				he performance of the LG G5 is super slick. The Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM shine - making everything from emails to gaming quick and easy.
<br><br>
I'm also a fan of the QHD display, which at 5.3 inches is excellent for a Netflix binge or a gaming session - although it's not quite as good as Samsung's Super AMOLED offering.
<br><br>
The dual cameras on the rear on the G5 are also a great addition - with the 8MP wide angle lens a genuinely useful feature which is easy to use and capable of producing impressive shots. The 16MP snapper isn't all that bad either - and even on auto mode it can take the odd photographic gem.
<br><br>
Then there's the modular aspect of the G5 - an area I'm properly excited about, but one that currently feels very much under developed. The technology has to start somewhere, but the somewhat pricey Cam Plus and Hi-Fi Plus modules don't exactly exite.
<br><br>
The hope is that third party developers will produce some really awesome modules in the next year to further enhance the LG G5. For the moment though, you'll be taking a punt on whether this will happen if you opt for the G5 now.

            	The LG G5 is a bit of a funny one. It's giving us a glimpse of the future thanks to the modular setup, but its true potential is currently unrealized, and things could stay that way for a while as we wait for exciting, new modules to appear.
<br><br>
Where does that leave us then? There's still a well built handset with a premium design - although not as premium as its competitors - a huge amount of power and a smart dual camera setup on the rear.
<br><br>
It's not like there's a shortage of features then, but somehow the G5 doesn't quite feel complete. There's nothing inherently wrong, the battery could be better, but it's lacking that final layer of finesse to pull everything together into a tidy package.
<br><br>
If you're in the market for a new flagship Android phone then the Galaxy S7 still delivers the best all-round experience, but for those looking for something a little bit different the LG G5 offers a few party pieces to keep things interesting.
