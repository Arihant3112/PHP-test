            	We won't beat around the bush: needing to improve upon a stellar phone in 2015's Galaxy S6, Samsung has made a handset that packs great battery smarts, excellent camera abilities and loads of raw power into an increasingly affordable package.
<br><br>
The design is similar to last year - meaning some have said this phone should be called the Galaxy S6S - but in this in-depth review it's clear that there's a lot more going on under the hood to supplement the improved design.
<br><br>
If you're looking for the curved phone variant of this design, the S7 isn't competing as closely with the Galaxy S7 Edge as the S6 was with the S6 Edge last year, with the curved display variant getting a bump in screen size this time round, taking it more into phablet territory.
<br><br>
If you know you're going to be away from a charger for an extended period, the Galaxy S7 has two options to help you make the battery last longer.
<br><br>
First up is the standard power-saving mode, which limits performance, vibrations and background data without cutting off any functionality. This can give you a few precious extra hours as your stumble home from a heavy night.
<br><br>
If you're really up against it, then Samsung's ultra-power-saving mode takes battery conservation to the extreme. This strips out all the fancy features of the Galaxy S7 and gives you a stripped down, black and white interface with access to only a handful of functions including calls, texts and a web browser.
<br><br>
Just how much extra time these modes give you will depend on individual usage, but with just 5% left in the tank the S7 was telling me that the standard power saver would only give me an additional two minutes over the 45 minutes it predicted the phone to last.
<br><br>
The ultra mode, however, claimed it could keep my phone going for 1 hour 45 minutes, which could be a real life-saver. Obviously, the more you have left in the tank when you enable these modes, the longer they'll be able to keep you going.
<br><br>
Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S7 has taken a positive step forward when it comes to battery life. It's not the best performer out there, and you'll want to plug in every night to be sure of a full day's use when you wake - but you won't find yourself dashing for the charger come mid-afternoon.
<br><br>
The best way to describe the Samsung Galaxy S7? Iterative perfection.
<br><br>
It takes the best bits from the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S6, and blends them together into a quite brilliant smartphone.
<br><br>
Samsung hasn't reinvented the wheel, but it has listened to feedback. It's righted the wrongs of the S6, reinstated key features and created a stand-out device.

  				The design may not look all that different, but I love how the Galaxy S7 sits in the palm. It's comfortable to hold, and the curved edges and reduced width means it's easier to use one-handed.
<br><br>
Samsung has refined the design from the S6 in all the right ways, including making the Galaxy S7 waterproof. This is a phone you won't want to put down.
<br><br>
Then there's the display, which still sports an eye-popping resolution and Super AMOLED technology, but is somehow brighter and more enchanting.
<br><br>
Samsung has freshened up TouchWiz, crammed the S7 full of power, and pulled off yet another supremely impressive smartphone camera - the low light performance of the 12MP snapper is something to behold.
<br><br>
I liked the always-on display way more than I thought I would - it's simple yet highly convenient - while Game Launcher is another nice touch, and improves the mobile gaming experience on the S7.

            <p>
            	Samsung has tweaked the winning design from the S6, righted the wrongs of its previous flagships, and made a phone you don't want to put down.
<br><br>
The Samsung Galaxy S7 is a worthy recipient of a five-star techradar review. That's no easy feat - only a handful of phones have ever hit the top mark - but the Galaxy S7 has earned its place in our hall of fame.
<br><br>
Is it worth the upgrade? If you're coming out of a two-year contract and you're looking for a flagship smartphone, then absolutely - the Galaxy S7 will blow your two-year-old handset out of the water. As long as you're comfortable with the price - and it really is worth it - then you won't look back.
<br><br>
For those considering trading in their Galaxy S6 (or other 2015 flagship), the case isn't quite as strong. The S6 still has a great screen, dazzling camera and plenty of power, so the step up may not feel big enough.
<br><br>
That said, the Galaxy S7 improves on pretty much every aspect of the S6, making it the best phone in the world right now, alongside the larger Galaxy S7 Edge. If money isn't an issue, the Galaxy S7 will justify the outlay - but the more cash-conscious may want to hold out for the Galaxy S8.
