            	The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a phone I'd hate to have had to make. Its predecessor was a multi-award-winning phone, simply because it packed all the power of the 'normal' Galaxy S6 and yet... that curved edge. I wasn't alone in loving it, whipping it out proudly whenever possible.
<br><br>
But that was last year, and the world is bored of the curved design. We've seen it. It's been done. So what can Samsung do to make the new phone a real step forward?
<br><br>
Well, unlike what it's done on the Galaxy S7, which looks (initially) like last year's model, the changes on the S7 Edge are brilliant, adding a zest to a design that could have quickly become tired.
<br><br>
The screen is larger, yet somehow the phone doesn't feel too much bigger in the hand. The rear of the phone is now curved too, making it sit nicely in the hand. It's waterproof. There's a microSD card slot. There's so much power in there I'm pretty sure I could strap it on the back of a speedboat and make my way across the Atlantic.
<br><br>
And that's even more possible because the battery - such a disappointment on last year's S6 phones - is boosted massively too, giving us a handset that's able to last over 24 hours between charges.
<br><br>
All this comes at a cost obviously, and a pretty hefty one. In the UK that cost is £640, while in the US you're looking at a huge $299 on a two-year contract, or the new unlocked price of $769. In Australia, the Galaxy S7 Edge attracts the highest price for a Galaxy yet: AU$1,249 for the 32GB version.
<br><br>
The Galaxy S7 Edge is a phone that lives and dies by its looks. If you're only interested in the power then just go for the standard Galaxy S7. The smaller, 'normal', model has got all the same smarts, but a slightly sharper screen thanks to packing the same amount of pixels into a smaller area.
<br><br>
Even the simple option to double-tap the home button to activate the camera (which is a really nice element, if not as fast as some others on the market) helps the snapper feel more usable and intuitive; Samsung has really thought about the way it's put this package together.
<br><br>
Whether you're shooting a big landscape or a wide-angle close-up, or just want to capture the moment, the Galaxy S7 Edge's camera performs superbly - take a look at the snaps on the next page to see what I mean.
<br><br>
It's nice to have a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to review - a handset from a brand that worked out what was missing from last year, and both addressed those issues and improved the phone in other ways to make it a distinct upgrade.
<br><br>
Is it the perfect phone? Surely no such thing exists...

  				The second you pick up the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, you know you're holding a premium phone. Actually, that moment happens before you pick it up, as when you get close to it the always-on display will intrigue you, and the blended curve design will entice a little further.
<br><br>
Perhaps that's a little hyperbolic, but it's the same feeling I got with the earlier HTC One line - a set of phones that draw you in at first look and first touch.
<br><br>
Then you can add the fact that this phone is waterproof, which gets people's eyes raised. To some, the microSD slot is a big win (although I still want to see how that works with a card inserted over time, to make sure it doesn't munch up performance)… and then there's the camera.
<br><br>
Some of the pictures I took were much better than I expected, and people were constantly commenting on the quality of even a quick snap.
<br><br>
Blown up and analysed, they're not DSLR quality, but for sharing on social media and viewing on phone screens (and even sent to a TV) they look sensational - this will be a real selling point for Samsung's new handsets.
<br><br>
The battery life improvements are a relief, and push Samsung back into the realm of 'decent enough power management'. You'll easily get a good day's use out of the Galaxy S7 Edge; it could be better, but it's something that sorely needed fixing, and Samsung has fixed it.
<br><br>
However, the main thing I liked about the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was that everything about it was a little bit above what I expected, whether that's the refinements to the home screen and interface, the improved power management, the speed and performance of the camera, the fact it can be thrown in a pond… it's these little improvements that add up to making a truly great phone.

            	As you can see above, the positives far outweigh the negatives with this handset. Once you're past the cost element (and that is something to take into consideration), you've got a phone that you'll find hard to put down.
<br><br>
Whether it's just rolling the refined chassis around in the hand, taking pictures that look great nine times out of 10, or just enjoying the clarity and sharpness of the screen, the Galaxy S7 Edge manages to delight, and stand out in a world where new smartphones are increasingly being offered with razor-thin differences between them.
<br><br>
We could always want more from our handsets - that seems to be the way we're programmed nowadays - but if you're looking for a well-designed, powerful phone that actually packs some useful day-to-day features, the Galaxy S7 Edge is the one to go for.
